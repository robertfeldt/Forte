# FORTE
This is a Framework for Optimized Regression Testing. It is based in research done from 2010 and forward by [Robert Feldt](http://www.robertfeldt.net) together with a number of industrial partners. They have agreed to make the results publically available. This git repository will be a clean version of FORTE with no ties to these companies; it will gradually reimplement the most successfull methods in an open-source fashion.


## License
FORTE can be freely used to analyse and optimize your regression testing data but the code itself is available with a GPL v3 license. If you want to use the code in your own products please email Robert directly and discuss commercial licensing.

FORTE will always be free to use though.
