# FORTE
This is a Framework for Optimized Regression Testing. Based on historical data on the outcomes from your testing it can predict future test outcomes. This can be used for prioritising testing efforts, reducing the size of test suites as well as, more generally, learn about your testing activities.

FORTE is based in research done from 2010 and forward by [Robert Feldt](http://www.robertfeldt.net) together with a number of industrial partners. They have agreed to make the results publically available. This git repository will be a clean version of FORTE with no ties to these companies; it will gradually reimplement the most successfull methods in an open-source fashion.

## Install

The preferred way of running FORTE is through [docker](http://www.docker.com).

## License
FORTE can be freely used to analyse and optimize your regression testing data but the code itself is available with a GPL v3 license. If you want to use the code in your own products please email Robert directly and discuss commercial licensing.

FORTE will always be free to use though.
